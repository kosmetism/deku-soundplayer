> Components for custom SoundCloud players with Deku. 

_Note:_ For now it's VERY lightweight port (e.g. there's no container components) of original [ReactSoundPlayer](https://github.com/soundblogs/react-soundplayer) and used inside [embeddable SoundCloud player](https://github.com/soundblogs/soundplayer-widget). 

```bash
npm install deku-soundplayer --save
```

<!-- To do:

- move <Player /> to soundplayer-widget
- add some docs here (mentioning react-soundplayer)
- release new version
- install new version to soundplayer-widget
- update widget styles to refer to updated classes
- release new version of soundplayer-widget
- install new versions to get-soundplayer-widget landing
- add store support as in deku to react version
- add after update support of new tracks to react version -->
